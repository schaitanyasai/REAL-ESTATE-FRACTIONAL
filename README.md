The goal of this project is to tokenize real estate assets, allowing investors to purchase fractional ownership in properties using Ethereum-based smart contracts.
💡 I built this project using Solidity for the backend smart contract, React.js for the frontend interface, and MetaMask to connect user wallets. The DApp is deployed on the Sepolia Testnet, and I've preloaded it with 1000 test ETH to simulate real-world transactions.
🔧 In this demo, I’ll show you:
How users can connect their wallets securely.
View token statistics like total supply and personal balance.
Mint new tokens (i.e., buy property shares).
Transfer tokens to another wallet — simulating resale or asset distribution.
And monitor their real estate token portfolio in real time.
💻 The UI is clean, minimalistic, and responsive — powered by Tailwind CSS. It’s designed to offer a seamless investment experience, even for first-time crypto users.
🧠 Behind the scenes, smart contracts manage token minting, transfer, and validation — all verified and deployed via Remix and MetaMask.
🌐 The vision of this project is to eventually support real-world properties — where even small investors can gain exposure to high-value assets without needing to buy entire properties.
🔐 This decentralized approach not only increases transparency and accessibility but also eliminates many intermediaries that increase traditional real estate costs.📈 This concept has applications in:
Real estate crowdfunding
DeFi asset collateralization
Digital ownership registries
